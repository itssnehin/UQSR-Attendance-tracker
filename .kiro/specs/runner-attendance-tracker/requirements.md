# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Runner Attendance Tracker is a web-based system designed for a university social runner's club to efficiently track attendance at daily social runs. The system provides a configurable calendar for scheduling runs, quick QR code-based registration for runners, and real-time attendance reporting through a web interface. Built with Python/FastAPI backend and SQLite database for simplicity and reliability, the system must handle peak loads of up to 100 concurrent registrations while maintaining ease of use for both administrators and runners.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a club administrator, I want to configure which days have scheduled runs, so that I can manage the running calendar based on university schedules and club activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the calendar configuration THEN the system SHALL display a calendar interface for the current semester
2. WHEN an administrator selects a date THEN the system SHALL allow them to mark it as a run day or non-run day
3. WHEN an administrator saves calendar changes THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration and update all related displays
4. IF a date is marked as a run day THEN the system SHALL generate a unique QR code for that specific run session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a runner, I want to quickly register my attendance by scanning a QR code, so that I can check in without delays or complicated processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a runner scans the QR code for a scheduled run THEN the system SHALL display a simple registration form
2. WHEN a runner submits their registration THEN the system SHALL record their attendance within 2 seconds
3. WHEN a runner attempts to register twice for the same run THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate registration and display an appropriate message
4. IF the system is under peak load (up to 100 concurrent users) THEN registration SHALL still complete within 5 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a club administrator, I want to view real-time attendance data on a website, so that I can monitor participation and make informed decisions about club activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the attendance dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current day attendance count
2. WHEN a new runner registers THEN the attendance tally SHALL update in real-time without page refresh
3. WHEN an administrator views historical data THEN the system SHALL display attendance records for previous runs
4. IF no runs are scheduled for the current day THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a runner, I want the registration process to work reliably during peak times, so that I can always check in even when many people are registering simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN up to 100 runners attempt to register simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle all requests without failure
2. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN response times SHALL not exceed 5 seconds for registration
3. IF the system encounters an error during registration THEN it SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry
4. WHEN peak load occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and prevent duplicate or lost registrations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a club administrator, I want to generate and display QR codes for each run, so that runners have a consistent and accessible way to register their attendance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a run day is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique QR code for that session
2. WHEN an administrator accesses the QR code display THEN the system SHALL show the code in a format suitable for projection or printing
3. WHEN a QR code is scanned THEN it SHALL direct users to the correct registration form for that specific run
4. IF a run is cancelled or rescheduled THEN the system SHALL invalidate the old QR code and generate a new one if needed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a club administrator, I want to export attendance data, so that I can analyze participation trends and create reports for club leadership.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide attendance data in CSV format
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include runner names, dates, and timestamps
3. WHEN an administrator specifies a date range THEN the system SHALL export only data within that range
4. IF no data exists for the specified period THEN the system SHALL provide an empty export with appropriate headers
